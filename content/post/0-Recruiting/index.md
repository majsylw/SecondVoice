**We are excited to finally announce that our project came to life!**
## What are we about?
HearAI is a non-profit, educational project which aims to build deep learning solution to make the world more accessible for Deaf community.
Our main goal is to expand existing knowledge base, working on segmentation and detection of Polish Sign Language phrases.

## Why this topic?
Deaf belong to the most excluded social groups.\
Communication is a huge problem and understanding Sign Language is a key to resolve it.
Deaf people learn Polish as a foreign language. Because of that they have difficult access to information and entertainment in their native language.\
We have also spotted the problem of lack of available data bases and solutions dedicated to Polish Sign Language.
We want to expand this knowledge base and try to raise attention to Deaf community problems.

## Our plan
For the next 6 months we will gather together online every week.\
Project is divided into several breakpoints:
* November - January -- Project preparation.
* January - April -- Model design, training & testing.
* April - June  -- Article preparation & summary.

To see detailed schedule [clik here](https://www.hearai.pl/about/).\
Our plan includes various technical and non-technical workshops with experienced speakers to expand our views on Deaf community problems, sign language, and technical knowledge. \
You will gain confidence in working in machine learing projects, have an opportunity to learn more about Deaf community problems and Sign Language as well as expand your technical knowledge.\
So far we've managed to connect 5 ML Enthusiasts and 3 Mentors but we know it is not enough!

# We are recruiting 7 more people to join our team!
We are looking for volunteers of all genders with willingness to commit to the 6-month-long project and spend their free time working on AI for good.
