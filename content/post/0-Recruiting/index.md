We are excited to announce that our project came to life finally!
What are we about? HearAI is a non-profit, educational project which aims to build deep learning solutions to make the world more accessible for the Deaf community. 
Our main goal is to use Deep Learning to recognize Polish Sign Language phrases, expand the existing knowledge base, and 

# Why this topic?
Deaf belong to the most excluded social groups. 
Communication is a huge problem, and understanding Sign Language is key to resolve it. 
Deaf people learn Polish as a foreign language. Because of that, they have difficult access to information and entertainment in their native language. 
We have also spotted the problem of the lack of open-source solutions dedicated to Polish Sign Language. 
We want to expand this knowledge base and try to raise attention to Deaf community problems.

# Our plan 
For the next six months, we will work together and gather online every week. 
Our plan includes various technical and non-technical workshops with experienced speakers to expand our views on Deaf community problems, sign language, and technical knowledge. 
We managed to connect 5 ML Enthusiasts and 5 Mentors, but we know it is not enough!

# We are recruiting seven more people to join our team!
We are looking for volunteers willing to commit to the 6-months project and spend their free time working on AI for good.
You will be a good match for our team if you:
* Have good Python skills,
* Have basic Machine Learning knowledge,
* Have free time and want to spend it on voluntary work,
* Are an open-minded team player,
* Have a willingness to learn and share your knowledge.
