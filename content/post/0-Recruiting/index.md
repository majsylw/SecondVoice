**We are excited to announce that our project came to life finally!**

## What is HearAI
HearAI is a nonprofit, educational project which aims to build deep learning solutions to make the world more accessible for the Deaf community.
Our main goal is to expand the existing knowledge base, working on segmentation and detecting Polish Sign Language phrases.

## Why this topic?
Deaf belong to the most excluded social groups.\
Communication is a huge problem, and understanding Sign Language is key to resolve it.
Deaf people learn Polish as a foreign language. Because of that, they have difficult access to information and entertainment in their native language.\
We have also spotted the problem of the lack of open-source solutions dedicated to Polish Sign Language.
We want to expand this knowledge base and try to raise attention to Deaf community problems.

## Our plan
For the next six months, we will gather together online every week.\
We divided the project into three breakpoints:
* November - January - Project planning.
* January - April - Model design, training & testing.
* April - June  - Article preparation & summary.
To see detailed schedule [clik here](https://www.hearai.pl/about/).\
Our plan includes various technical and non-technical workshops with experienced speakers to expand our views on Deaf community problems, sign language, and technical knowledge. 	 

You will gain confidence in working in machine learning projects, have an opportunity to learn more about Deaf community problems and Sign Language, and expand your technical knowledge.\
For the next six months, we will work together and gather online every week.

We managed to connect 5 ML Enthusiasts and 5 Mentors, but we know it is not enough!
