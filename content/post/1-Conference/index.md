With great pleasure we would like to announce our additional **surprise** coming alive!

On November 20th and 21st you will have a unique opportunity to join our **LIVE EVENT**, during which great field experts will share their knowledge!

## Why did we decide to organize such an event?

We truly believe that many people do not realize how a typical day of a Deaf person looks like. When working on the HearAI project, we faced ridiculous questions many times (see below). Of course, there is nothing wrong with asking questions. In the end, thanks to them we’ve decided to do something about it and try to increase the public awareness. Those questions just let us see the scale of a problem.

## What about those questions?

Under some of our posts on social media we’ve found many similar questions: what is the purpose of our project if Deaf could just type on a keyboard - No, they can’t, in many cases they do not know spoken language at all.

The other question, that I found important as it proves how little do we (as not Deaf people) know, was related to one of our motivations. We’ve learned that Deafs do not have access to the news, especially during a pandemic. As they may not know written Polish, they can’t just search for any info online. Many people pointed out: They can watch news on tv, there is one channel that provides a translator - No, they can’t, as this translator does not use Polish Sign Language. A notation that was developed by hearing people for Deafs is used there.

Wanna know more about it? Join our event!

## Please notice that a Polish Sign Language translator will attend each of the sessions and provide an online translation.
