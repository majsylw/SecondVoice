We are excited to finally announce that our project came to life!
What we are about? Hear.AI is a non-profit, educational project which aims to build deep learning solution to make the world more accessible for Deaf community. 
Our main goal is to expand existing knowledge base, working on segmentation and detection of Polish Sign Language phrases.

# Why this topic?
Deaf belong to the most excluded social groups. 
Communication is a huge problem and understanding Sign Language is a key to resolve it. 
Deaf people learn Polish as a foreign language. Because of that they have difficult access to information and entertainment in their native language. 
We have also spotted the problem of lack of avaible data bases and solutions dedicated to Polish Sign Language. 
We want to expand this knowledge base and try to raise attention to Deaf community problems.


# Our plan 
For the next 6 months we will gather together online every week. 
Our plan includes various workshops (both technical and non-technical) with experienced speakers
to have different views on Deaf community problems and Sign Language as well as to expand our technical knowledge. 
We managed to connect 7 ML Enthusiasts and 3 Mentors but we know it is not enough!

# We are recruiting 5 more people to join our team!
We are looking for volunteers with willingness to commit to the 6-months project and spend their free time working on AI for good.
You will be a good match for our team if you:
* Have good Python skills.
* Have (basic) knowledge of Machine Learning solutions.
* Have free time and want to spend it on volutary work.
* Are a team player.
* Are open minded.
* Have willingness to learn and share your knowledge.
