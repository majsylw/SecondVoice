I studied pedagogy: care and early childhood support at Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz (2012-2015) and speech therapy at the University of Gdansk (2015-2017).
Currently I am completing my degree in pedagogy with preschool and early childhood education.
During my studies I was a member of the Scientific Circle of Speech Therapists and the Scientific Circle of Supporting and Creating Child Development.
I have participated in numerous volunteer activities, including at the J.Korczak House - Regional Care and Therapeutic Centre in Gdansk.
I have completed the PSL (Polish Sign Language) first degree course.
I had an internship at the Specialized Centre for Diagnosis and Rehabilitation of Children and Youth with Hearing Impairment in Gda≈Ñsk. 
Currently I am a lead preschool teacher.
