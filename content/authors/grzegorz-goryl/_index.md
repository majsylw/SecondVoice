After my PhD in Physics/Nanoscience and post graduate studies in Financial Engineering/Stochastic Calculus area I moved into data modeling for financial institutions. My experience covers models for high frequency trading, valuation of credit derivatives together with credit risk itself. Recently, I have been developing NLP models for voice/chatbots and  documents processing. I have been programming since my childhood, now I am a big fan of R, however, I can code in python, java and logo ðŸ˜‰

In my professional career I follow the  motto: a day without learning new things is the lost day. Although my profession is my hobby, I am interested also in philosophical aspects of science and AI. Last but not least, I am a wine enthusiast with international certificate WSET Level 2 Award in Wines and Spirits.
