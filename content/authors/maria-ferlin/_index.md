I am a machine learning enthusiast and strongly believe that technological progress might be used to help people, not only to entertain them.
On a daily basis I am conducting research as a PhD student at Gdansk University of Technology.
My main field of interest is machine learning in medicine.
In my free time I go to the gym and meet with friends. I also love travelling and dancing! :)
