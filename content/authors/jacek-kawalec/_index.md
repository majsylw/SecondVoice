About me - in 1995 I co-founded the portal Wirtualna Polska wp.pl (WPL), later sold to French Telecom in 2005.
I have worked for Oracle Corp in both Poland and the USA.
In 2005, I started investing in startups, and in 2012 started working with voicelab.ai on machine learning in particular speech recognition, 
voice biometrics, and speech analysis technology.
